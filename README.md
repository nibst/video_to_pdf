# Video to pdf
This is just a joke project based on a meme I saw.
This code just convert every frame of a video to a page in pdf. Its a one to one match between frames and pages.
Needless to say, this is very slow and will output large pdfs in case of somewhat bigger videos

## Usage
```
python video_to_pdf.py -v <path_to_video> -o <name_of_output.pdf>
```
That's it.
